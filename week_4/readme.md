# Problem: Create a ToDo Application-
## ToDo folder
create a ToDo
Add Details to it
then we should be able to delete it too using a button that appears after the their is something in the todo

Append Elements one by one

All done in index.html

It was ugly way

### Smart way- document.createElement

div having 3 div child and button,put them into parent div and append whole thing into main dom

append this div into child div and then the child div into the parent div 

new file: 
## ToDo.html

simplified as compared to index.html
We did only for adding,what about updating and deleting

## Assignment - Assignment.html
Given a state
write a function that renders it accordingly
