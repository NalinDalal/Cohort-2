# Cohort_Code
Well I had clearly keeping of the lectures and code but this repo will contain all type of code explained in Cohort, it's implementation and description
as the previous is only just u know was mix of everything,but now we will kep track of everything from week 0 also it will strictly contain only .md files

The code will be kept in hierarchial order as per weeks at it's respective place

We will simply need to create file,do their documentation in separate file and move to next code,that's all from my side
The video of same wiil be made & uploaded accordingly

Note this can be made as linkedin & twitter post too
