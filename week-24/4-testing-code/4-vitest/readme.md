`https://vitest.dev/` is the mildly recent entrant in the testing framework market.
It has a bunch of benefits over jest, specially has great support for TS.
So weâ€™ll be moving to vitest for all future tests
It is highly compatable with jest
Link to why vitest - `https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html`

bootstrap with vitest

```bash
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
npm install express @types/express zod
```

update tsconfig.json

```json
"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist"
```

create `src/index.ts` file

install vitest-> `npm i -D vitest`

add simple `test/index.test.ts` file

add script to `package.json` ->

```json
"test":"vitest"
```

run tests

```bash
npm run test
```

Add supertest

```bash
npm i supertest @types/supertest
```

update test {vitest is highly compatible with the jest api}
