# What is Linting

Linting is the process of running a program that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors.

## Why lint?

1. Multiple developers in a team can have a similar coding pattern
2. Good readability of the code
3. Automatic Linting so developer doesnt have to manually lint their code

## Tools
