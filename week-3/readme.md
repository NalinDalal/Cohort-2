# Authentications
We will be using Middlewares and Zod along with a concept global catches

## Hospital:
Say we have a covid scenario in which the person has 3 test b/f reaching doctor:
1. Aadhar Card,Insurance Enquiry(if yes, then proceed)
2. Blood Test(no STD,Proceed)
3. blood Pressure(reasonable,proceed)

All these test are sort of pre check for the patient to be treated

Now this was Single Threaded JS

## 2.js
We did a simple authentication in 2.js which was working,
In order to test it,in postman run it by providing the url of localhost and parameters

## 3.final_1.js:
We will do a better input validation in this kind of file with code optimisation in it but before that we will do the assignments in the same file hence the one in which the final code will be 3.final_1.js in it

It fu**ing runs

## 4.js,5.zod.js,6.zod.js
They use something known as zod for better input validation just like 3.final_1.js

# DataBases & Auth:
u know to store the stuff too
from 7.js or whatever,we did that part to successfully,with it's own documentation
7,8,9.js

## Problems:
Data stored in memory-> Static,Lost when server is restart
                     -> Multiple Servers in the world
BackEnd connection to database using Mongoose

# MiddleWares
Middlewares-function having access to request objects
10.js
11.js-middleware used

## 12.js-try and catch

## 13.html-DOM
