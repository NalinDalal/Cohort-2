Open Source alternative for New Relic- Prometheus + Grafana + Loki

# Prometheus

Prometheus is a time series DB. It can monitor your

1. Processes (node, go, rust…)
2. Hosts

![Overview](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
works on a pull architecture.

## Main Feactures

Prometheus's main features are:

- a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
- PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
- no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
- pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
- multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support

# Adding raw metrics

Let’s add some `hand made` metrics to an express app

- Initialize a TS project

```bash
mkdir 2
cd 2
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```

change the rootDir, outDir

Add dependencies

```bash
npm install express @types/express
```

Create `src/index.ts`, `src/middleware.ts`

update the package.json->

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -b",
    "start": "npm run build && node dist/index.js"
},
```

Run the application
`npm run start`

install the prom-client -> `npm install prom-client`
adding metrics-> metrics/requestCount.ts

# Gauge

Lets add a gauge metric to our app

- Create `metrics/activeRequests.ts` , export a `Gauge` from it
- Import it and update `metrics/index.ts`

hit the user points few times;Check the metrics

'slide 8'-> add the histogram code

okay so it runs correctly, provides a data at `http://localhost:3000/metrics`

# Actually starting prometheus

Until now, we’ve exposed a `/metrics` endpoint but no one is `scraping` using it.
Prometheus actually scrapes (pulls) these metrics so you can visualise them over time (time series data)
For that, you need to start prometheus and give it the `source` of the metrics.

- Add `prometheus.yml`

Start prometheus locally

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 -v ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
```

creates a prometheus dashboard at `http://localhost:9090` status>targets

## Containerising the app

- Create a Dockerfile for the Node app
- Create a docker-compose that starts the nodejs app as well as the prom container
- Update prometheus.yml
- Start docker compose `docker compose up`

# Queries in Prom

## Simple queries (counters and gauges)

Here are some Prometheus queries you can run on `localhost:9090` to analyze the metrics provided:

1. Total Number of HTTP Requests
   To get the total number of HTTP requests per route-> `http_requests_total`

2. Total Number of HTTP Requests (cumulative)-> `sum(http_requests_total)`

3. HTTP Request Duration -> `http_request_duration_ms_sum`

4. Count of total number of http requests -> `http_request_duration_ms_count`

5. Average time it took to handle all requests -> `http_request_duration_ms_sum / http_request_duration_ms_count`

## Complex queries (histograms)

1. See the request duration in buckets-> `http_request_duration_ms_bucket`
2. See requests for a specific route-> `http_request_duration_ms_bucket{method="GET", route="/metrics", code="200"}`

# Graphs in prom

Prometheus also lets you visualise data as graphs
Lets see a few queries

1. Total number of requests - `http_requests_total`
2. Rate of number of requests - `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`
3. Rate of all the requests (sum up /metrics and /user requests) - `sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))`
4. Average HTTP request duration with timeseries (5 minute buckets) - `rate(http_request_duration_ms_sum[5m]) / rate(http_request_duration_ms_count[5m])`

# Grafana

Even though you can use the prom interface, grafanna makes your life much easier
You can connect your prometheus data to grafana to be able to visualise your data better
Installing grafana in docker compose
Update docker-compose

Try visiting localhost:3001 -> `admin` is id, password is `admin`

- Create a connection to prometheus, url is `http://prometheus:9090`

In Grafana, click Administration > Plugins and data > Plugins in the side navigation menu to view all plugins.
Browse and find a plugin.
Click the plugin’s logo.
Click Install.

- Create a dashboard->
  Try building a dashboard that has

1. Total number of requests to /metrics endpoint
2. Number of http requests to the /metrics endpoint per second
3. Total number of requests to the /user endpoint
4. Number of http request to the /user endpoint per second
5. A gauge that lets you see the current active requests

You want to create a dashboard in Grafana similar to the one shown in your screenshot. Here’s how you can replicate or customize a similar dashboard:

### Steps to Create a Similar Grafana Dashboard

1. **Set Up Prometheus as a Data Source**:

   - Go to **Configuration** (gear icon) > **Data Sources** > **Add data source** in Grafana.
   - Select **Prometheus** and configure it by providing the Prometheus server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`).

2. **Create a New Dashboard**:

   - Click on the **+** icon and select **Dashboard** > **New Dashboard**.
   - Click on **Add new panel** to start adding visualizations.

3. **Replicating Panels**:

   - **User requests per second**: Use a query like:

     ```promql
     rate(http_requests_total{job="your-job-name"}[1m])
     ```

     Choose a **Graph** visualization and configure axes, legend, and other options to match your style.

   - **User request total**: A query like:

     ```promql
     sum(http_requests_total{job="your-job-name"})
     ```

     Set this up as a **Single Stat** or **Gauge** panel.

   - **Metrics total requests**: Use the query:

     ```promql
     http_requests_total{job="your-job-name"}
     ```

     and display it as a **Graph**.

   - **Metrics requests per second**: Use a similar **rate()** query as above but customize it further with filters.

   - **Active requests**: If you're tracking active requests, use a query like:
     ```promql
     active_requests{job="your-job-name"}
     ```
     Set this as a **Gauge** or **Single Stat** panel.

4. **Panel Customization**:

   - Arrange your panels as per the layout in the screenshot.
   - Customize titles, descriptions, and other panel settings.
   - Adjust time ranges and refresh intervals for each panel.

5. **Save and Organize**:

   - Save your dashboard and organize it within folders if you have multiple dashboards.

6. **Adjust and Monitor**:
   - Continue monitoring and refining your dashboard as needed. You can always add more panels or modify existing ones.

# Alerting Rules

Grafana provides you with a way to set alerts on metrics.
NavBar>Alerting

## Steps

1. Enter a name for it - High number of requests
2. Define query

```grafna
rate(http_requests_total{route="/user"}[$__rate_interval])
```

3. Setup alert threshold (lets say 50 requests/s)
4. Set evaluation behaviour
   a. How often should we check this alert?
   b. Create folder so that it can be re-used later
5. Add labels
   a. Team: Backend
   b. Type: Error

6. Save

## Testing

Send a lot of requests to the /user endpoint and ensure it triggers the alert

## Notifying

1. Create a new contact point
2. Connect the alert to the contact point in `Notification policies`
   This will not send a real email unless you’ve put in SMTP credentials while starting the apps

Done!!
